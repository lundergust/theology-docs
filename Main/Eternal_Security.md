Also known as **"Once save always saved"**, this is the idea that believers are 100% confident they are saved.

#[Differing Views](Differing_Views.md)
1. Believer is elect by divine predetermination (Calvin)
2. Regerenation leads to unconditional perserverance (Non-Calvin, majority)
3. Regeneration leads to salvation independently of perserverance (Free Grace)

##[Calvinist Theology](Calvinist_Theology.md)
- Theological determinism -> Every world event is determined by God
- God determines whether an individual is saved or damned
- Perserverance of the saints grants unconditional preservation of  the elect
  - Apostasy is not possible
- How do we get around someone who appears saved but then falls away?
  - Temporary grace (evanescent grace)
    - The Holy Spirit creates effects that are indistinguishable from the effects of irresistable grace
    - OR is this real grace that only stays for some time?
    - This also produces visible fruit 
    - Still cant tell who is true Christian and who is not
- How do we get from here to eternal security?
  - Heidelberg Catechism (1563)
  - Westmister Confession of Faith (1646)
  - Steps to get eternal security:
    1. Believer must embrace Calvinism
    2. Discern the influence of Holy Spirit through self-examination
       - This leads to faith in their own predetermined election

##[Southern Baptist Theology](Southern_Baptist_Theology.md)
- 1830s, groups departed from strict orthodox Calvanism
- Individuals have the libertarian free will to choose faith through grace.
- Regardless of any action after regeneration, whether they continue to believe or not, they will be saved
  - James Robinson Graves
  - W.P. Bennett

##[Plymouth Brethren Theology (Calvinistic dispensationalism)](Plymouth_Brethren_Theology_(Calvinistic_dispensationalism).md)
- Anglican Calvinist leader John Nelson Darby 1800s
- Dispensationlism allows perserverance of saints to merge with libertarian free will

#[Exegesis](Exegesis.md)
##[Hebrews 6:4-6, 10:26-39](Hebrews_6:4-6,_10:26-39.md)
- **Hypothetical view**
  - Warnings are hypothetical, intending to scare believers into perserverance
  - Or desribes temporary backsliding
- **Phenomenological-false-believer view**
  - Those who commit these sins were never true believers
  - Referring to unbelievers who benefitted from God's grace but are skeptics
- **Covenant community view**
  - Warnings refer to rejection of a covenant community by God when the whole community turns away
