### Martin Luther

- Affirmed perpetual virginity
- Rejected the power of intercession of her or any saint
- Smalcald Articles
    - Confession of faith of Lutheran churches
    - Affirms the perpetual virginity
- Missouri Synod Lutheran churches allow the possibility that Mary and Josheph had other children
- Seems to believe in the immaculate conception, and Mary's sinlessness
    - "God has formed the soul and body of the Virgin Mary full of the Holy Spirit, so that she is without all sins, for she has conceived and borne the Load Jesus ... Mother Mary, like us, was born in sin of sinful parents, but the Holy Spirit covered her, sanctified and purified her so that this child was born of flesh and blood, but not with sinful flesh and blood. The Holy Spirit permitted the Virgin Mary to remain a true, natural human being of flesh and blood, just as we. However, He warded off sin from her flesh and blood so that she became the mother of a pure child, not poisoned by sin as we are. For in that moment when she conceived, she was a hold mother filled wiht the Holy Spirit and her fruit is a hold pure fruit, at once God and truly man, in one person."
- in *Magnificat*, Luther states that one should pray to Mary, so that God would give through her will.
    - He clarifies that it is God's work alone
- Approves Marian songs, paintings, and statues
- Advocated the use of the pre-Trent versino of the Hail Mary

### John Calvin
Calvin's views are summarized in the Second Helvetic Confession, by Heinrich Bullinger. Basically, he did not deny perpetual virginity, but took exception to any prayer to, or icons of Mary.

- Matthew 1:25 
    - The term "firstborn" and "till" do not contradict p.v
    - But we cant know what happened afterwards from this verse
-  Luke 1:34
    - Absurd that this means Mary is taking a vow of p.v.
    - If she had taken this vow, she would have violated it by taking a husband
- Affirmed *"Mother of God"* as a concept
    - 27 September 1552 letter to French Church in London
    - But rejected the use as a common title for her in sermons
        - *"I cannot think such language either right, or becoming, or suitable. ... To call the Virgin Mary the mother of God can only serve to confirm the ignorant in their superstitions"*
    - Luke 1:43
        - *"Elizabeth calls Mary the mother of her Lord. This denotes a unity of person in the two natures of Christ; as if she had said, that he who was begotten a mortal man in the womb of Mary is, at the same time, the eternal God... This name **Lord** strictly belongs to the Son of God 'manifested in the flesh' (1 Timothy 3:16) who has received from the Father all power, and has been appointed the highest ruler of heaven and earth, that by his agency God may govern all things."*
        - This objection, when understood with the above, seems to be regarding using the title as veneration, not the concept itself.
    - Some say he thinks Mary was his mother only while He was on earth. 
        - John 19:26
            - *When Jesus saw his mother and the disciple whom he loved standing beside her, He said to His mother, "Woman, here is your son"*
            - *"Some think that He does not call her 'mother' but only 'woman' so as not to inflict a deeper wound of sorrow on her heart. I do not reject this; but another conjecture is no less probable, that Christ wanted to show that now that He has completed the course of human life, He puts off the condition in which He has lived and enters into the heavenly kingdom where He will rule over angels and men. For we know that Christ's custom always was to recall believers from looking at the flesh. This was especially necessary at His death"*
- Denied immaculate conception. His reasons can be inferred from the following: 
    - Affirmed Original Sin
    - Affirmed doctrine of headship, from Romans 5:12-21
        - Sin enters the world through the male, Adam
    - Therefore, Mary could have original sin and not pass it on to Jesus because there was no earthly Father
    - *"We condemn those who affirm that a man once justified cannot sin. .. As to the special privilege of the Virgin Mary, when they produce the celestial diploma we shall believe what they say"*
        - Is this about immaculate conception, or something else?
- Denied Mary having any participation in salvation
- Denied that Mary is a mediator between man and God
    - Forbade prayers and supplications to Mary
- Praying to the dead is not supported by scripture





## Pushback

- [Tertullian (155-220 AD)](Writers/Tertullian.md)
- Antedicomarians (3rd - 5th Century)
    - Refused Mary any special status
    - Considered Joseph to be a widower with 6 previous children
    - Initially, rejected the virgin birth and considered Joseph to be the father of Jesus
        - Later accepted this, but continued to deny perpetual virginity
        - Viewed the brothers of Jesus mentioned in scripture to be Mary's other children
- Jovinian (4th Century)
    - Denied the perpetual virginity
    - Opposted monasticism
    - Every believer has an equal reward in heaven
    - No difference between fasting and enjoying foods with thanksgiving
    - Distinguished church invisible from visible

    - The brothers are Mary and Joseph's kids born after Jesus


### In Scripture

- Mark 6:3
    - *Is this not the carpenter, the Son of Mary, and brother of James, Joses, Judas, and Simon? And are not His sisters here with us?*

For whoever does the will of My Father in heaven is My brother and sister and mother.'</Jesus>*
- Mark 3:31-35
    - *Then His brothers and His mother came, and standing outside they sent to Him, calling Him. And a multitude was sitting around Him; and they said to Him, 'Look, Your mother and Your brothers are outside seeking You.' But he answered them, saying <Jesus>'Who is My mother, or My brothers?'**</Jesus> And He looked around in a circle at those who sat about Him, and said, <Jesus>'Here are My mother and My brothers! For whoever does the will of God is My brother and My sister and mother'</Jesus>.*
- Luke 8:18
    - *Then His mother and brothers came to Him, and could not approach Him because of the crowd. And it was told Him by some, who said, 'Your mother and Your brothers are standing outside, desiring to see You.' But He answered and said to them, <Jesus>'My mother and My brothers are these who hear the word of God and do it'</Jesus>.*
- Acts 1:14
    - *These all continued with the women and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with His brothers*

- Mark 15:40,47 
    - *There were also women looking on from afar, among whom were Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James the Less and of Joses, and Salome*


### James the brother of Jesus
Scholars mostly agree that James the brother of Jesus (James the Just) is referenced by Paul. References to James include:
- 1 Corinthians 15:7
    - *After that He was seen by James, then by all the apostles*s
- Eusebius of Caesarear (339)
    - James spent so much time in prayer that his knees became *"like the knees of a camel"*
    - Created a list of 12 bishops of the early church, where Joseph/Joses and Jude are listed, who may be the brothers of Jesus
- Clement of Alexandria, reported by Eusebius
    - James was chosen as a bishop of Jerusalem
    - He became the principle authority in Jerusalem church after Peter left, presiding at Council of Jerusalem in Acts 15. 
- Galatians 1:19
    - It is unclear if James is included as an apostle or not here
- Galatians 2:9
    - *and when James, Cephas, and John, who seemed to be pillars, ...*
    - This is taken to be James the brother of Jesus, not James the brother of John.
        - Probably because he is in Jerusalem church






### Other Thoughts
- If blood brothers, they should have been present at His burial, but they are not mentioned
