The elect will receive salvation. 
Also called Preservation of the saints, empahasizing that God determines who is elect and who preserveres. 
But, believers cannot have certainty of their own salvation.

## Emergence
- 4th Century, Manichaeism maintains God unilaterally selected the elect for salvation and the non-elect for damnation
- 5th Century, Augustine
    - Unborn, unbaptized infants were condemed (Manichaen doctrine), but baptism regenerated them
    - God predetermines parents to baptism the babies, and thereby predetermines the babies
        - This leads to a problem, since some baptised babies fall away
    - Among those who receive baptism, some receive an additional gift of perserverance
        - This is election by determinism, but not yet perserverance of the saints 
        - And we cannot yet have eternal security since we dont know who receives this gift
