## In Calvinism
Before the foundation of the world, God chose certain individuals, the **elect**, to receive eternal salvation. 
This is *unconditional*, meaning not based on human merit or works, but solely on God's soverign will. 

### OT Support
- Israelites are called to be the *Chosen People*, or *People of God*
- Deuteronomy
- Isaiah 40-66

### NT Support
The meaning now becomes the members of the body of Christ, on earth or in heaven, rather than the people of Israel
- Matthew 7:13-14  *"...narrow is the gate that leads to life"*
  - This is taken to mean there are a small number of elect
