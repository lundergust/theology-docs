    - Building off Anselm, combined the satisfaction and punishment.
- John Calvin
    - Appropriated Anselm and created the criminal law terminology
        - Man is *guilty* before God
        - The *wages* of sin is eternal death
        - Jesus paid the fine, submitted as a criminal, sustained and suffered all of the punishment that was due for the sinners

    - If Jesus is God, then God accepts the penalty onto Himself. 
    - Therefore, there is no injustice in punishing the innocent
    - Also He is no appeasing some third party justice

##[Criticisms](Criticisms.md)
- Anabaptist criticism
    - Perfect satisfaction for sin leaves no room for divine forgiveness or pardon
    - Punishing the innocent and letting the guilty go free is the definition of injustice
    - The finite suffering and temporary death of one (Jesus) is disproportionate to to the infinite suffering and permanent death of many
    - The grace required for perfect satisfaction seems to give a freedom to sin without consequence
- Ideas of justice and punishment are not the same in Jewish, Roman, and 16th century, and modern law
    - *Satisfaction* and *merit* work well with Roman law, but not with Jewish law
    - The term *penal* means different things in all of these contexts
- In Calvin's theology, the legal framework is mixed with a cultic process
    - Calvin asserts it is necessary for Jesus to go through a judicial process to be condemed as a criminal, but the circumstances around Pontius Pilate and his death are a corrupt legal process
- Guilt is inherently non-transferable. 
- If damnation is what is owed to sinners, and is the seperation from God, then Jesus was seperated from God, splitting the trinity.    

#[Unlimited Atonment (universal, general)](Unlimited_Atonment_(universal,_general).md)
- Jesus died as a propitiation for all humans, without exception
- No limits on who can believe through faith
- Legal payment is still required to those that respond through faith
- Does **not** state that Jesus's death was payment for those who reject Him
