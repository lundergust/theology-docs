## Worship
Early Church worship was liturgical. Three main early sources:
- Didache - *The teaching of the twelve* (70 AD)
  - Eucharist
- St. Justin Martyr - First Apology (150 AD)
  - Pattern of Christian worship
    - Synaxis (meeting)
      - Greeting and Response
      - Hymns
      - Readings from Scripture (the *Apostles Memoirs*)
      - The Homily
      - Dismissal of those not in the Church
    - Eucharist (the thanksgiving)
      - Intercessory Prayers
      - Offeratory of bread and wine
      - Consecration of Gifts
      - Communion
      - Giving of Thanks
      - Benediction
      - Form of this is based upon liturgy of Old Testament Priest in the temple
- Apostolic Tradition of Hypolytus (200 AD)
  - Mostly backed up Justin Martyr


1 Corinthians 11


- Does liturgical worship lead to spiritual death?
    - Israel was liturgical throughout entire history
    - Early church was liturgical at its inception
    - Current Church services are not different in practice from this
        - Same people come 
        - Sit in same chairs
        - "Spontaneous" prayers are essentially the same every time
        - Everyone has their same preferred worship songs
        - Sermon occurred at the same point in the service
    - Joe note - What makes evangelical services not boring?
        - Is it the pastors?
        - Or is it the Holy Spirit?
        - If the Holy Spirit is present in the orthodox church, then it will not be boring



## Eucharist
- Eucharist was seen as both a symbol, and a substance
  - but no transubstantiation until centuries later
  - Key word is *mystery*
- Consecrated bread and wine are actual body and blood of Christ, but we dont know how
- 1 Corinthians 11
  - Why would people get sick and die if the eucharist is just a symbol?


## Church History
- Bishops are present before 100 AD
  - Polycarp, Bishop of Smyrna
    - Iraneaus says he was the spiritual son of Apostle John






joe note
- 3 attacks on liturgy causing us to get bored
    - We are already in a situation where we are bored
    - Early Church, and Israel were always liturgical, and didnt appear to be bored
    - Modern church already behaves liturgically, they just dont embrace it. 
        - humans want to operate liturgically
