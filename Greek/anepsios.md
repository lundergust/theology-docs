*Anepsios* is never used to describe James, or the other 'brothers' of Jesus
However, *Anepsios* is only used once in the NT (Colossians)

Neither Hebrew nor Aramaic have a word for 'cousin', both typically refer to them as 'son of an uncle', in Hebrew *ben dod*, in Aramaic *bar dad*.
The Septuagint never translates either of these words to 'brother' or 'sister'
