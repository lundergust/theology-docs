The only condition for salvation is faith, excluding good works and perserverance, with eternal security. 
Good works are part of discipleship, and result in more eternal rewards.
This is also held with eternal security, so the believer will be certain of salvation despite moral failings. 
However, there is some divine punishment that is not damnation.

- Salvation = the call to believe in Christ and receive eternal life
- Discipleship = the call to follow cChrist and be obedient

## Beliefs
1. Faith Alone
    - John 3:14-17
    - Numbers 21
2. Relationship differs from intimacy
    - Being reborn as Christs follower gives familial relationship, but not intimacy, which comes by obedience
3. Justification differs from sanctification
    - Justification is free gift
    - Sanctification comes by obedience, and is not gauranteed
4. Eternal security
5. Rewards and Discipline
    - Judgement day gives rewards or temporary punishments, but not heaven or hell.

## Views on Repentance
1. Change of mind, not a turning from sin (synonym for faith)
2. Turning from sin, but not a requirement for eternal life

## Works
- James 2:17
    - Dead faith refers to one that is not profitable in the judgement seat

## Atonement
- Unlimited
- Penal substitution
